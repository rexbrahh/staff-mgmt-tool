# Daily Log: April 23, 2025

## Planned Tasks

### Frontend-Backend Integration (Priority)
- [ ] Connect authentication frontend to backend API
  - [ ] Implement login form submission to auth endpoints
  - [ ] Store JWT token in localStorage and Redux
  - [ ] Add authentication state management
  - [ ] Implement logout functionality
  - [ ] Create protected route wrapper components

- [ ] Integrate staff profile management with API
  - [ ] Create service for staff profile CRUD operations
  - [ ] Build profile listing page with data from API
  - [ ] Develop profile detail view component
  - [ ] Implement profile creation and editing forms
  - [ ] Add validation matching backend requirements

- [ ] Begin attendance system UI development
  - [ ] Create check-in/check-out interface
  - [ ] Build attendance history view
  - [ ] Implement manager attendance oversight dashboard
  - [ ] Add attendance status indicators

### Recommendations

#### Technical Approach
1. **API Service Layer**
   - Create a centralized service layer for API communications
   - Implement interceptors for authentication token handling
   - Add consistent error handling across all API calls
   - Develop retry logic for intermittent connection issues

2. **State Management Strategy**
   - Organize Redux slices by feature domain (auth, profiles, attendance, leave)
   - Implement entity adapter pattern for efficient data storage
   - Add loading and error states for all API operations
   - Consider using RTK Query for common data fetching patterns

3. **Component Architecture**
   - Build reusable form components for consistent UX
   - Create HOCs or hooks for common behaviors
   - Implement proper loading states and error boundaries
   - Use React's Suspense for code-splitting where appropriate

4. **Testing Considerations**
   - Create unit tests for service layer functionality
   - Add component tests for critical UI flows
   - Implement integration tests for Redux actions and reducers
   - Set up end-to-end tests for authentication flow

#### Potential Challenges
- Cross-origin issues if frontend and backend are on different domains
- Token refresh handling for long user sessions
- Form state management for complex editing scenarios
- Date/time handling across timezone differences

## Preparation Steps
- Review backend API documentation
- Ensure development environment has proper CORS configuration
- Check frontend dependencies are up to date
- Review Material UI component documentation for form components
- Prepare test data for each integration point

## Success Criteria
- User should be able to log in and out successfully
- Staff profiles should load, display, create, and update properly
- Authentication state should persist across page refreshes
- Protected routes should redirect unauthenticated users
- Error states should be handled gracefully with user feedback
