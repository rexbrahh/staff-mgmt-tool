# Daily Log: April 22, 2025

## Tasks Completed

### Staff Profile Management Implementation
- Created the `StaffProfile` model with comprehensive fields for employee information
- Implemented CRUD operations with proper role-based permissions
- Added field validation and error handling
- Created routes for staff profile management with appropriate access controls

### Attendance System Development
- Developed the `Attendance` model for tracking employee check-ins and check-outs
- Implemented daily attendance status tracking functionality
- Added features for marking absences and calculating work hours
- Created endpoints for retrieving attendance history
- Added admin/manager controls for attendance management

### Leave Management System
- Implemented the `Leave` model with various leave types (sick, vacation, etc.)
- Created workflow for leave requests, approvals, and rejections
- Added management features for leave history and status tracking
- Implemented role-based permissions for leave management

### Data Seeding
- Added script to create placeholder users with different roles for testing
- Created sample staff profiles with relevant data
- Set up demo data for development and testing

### Bug Fixes
- Resolved TypeScript compatibility issues with the authentication system
- Fixed type checking for user roles and permissions
- Updated route handlers to work seamlessly with existing middleware

### Version Control Updates
- Created development branch for ongoing work
- Implemented branching strategy: development work on `dev` branch, stable releases on `main` branch
- Configured all future feature implementations to use feature branches off `dev`

### Project Documentation
- Updated the main development log with comprehensive project history
- Documented current progress and future plans in development log
- Created directory structure for daily logs

## Challenges Encountered
- TypeScript typing issues with request user objects
- Integration between authentication middleware and new controllers
- Proper error handling for edge cases in leave management

## Solutions Implemented
- Used type assertions to ensure proper typing in controllers
- Updated middleware functions to work with controller expectations
- Added comprehensive error handling in sensitive operations

## Key Observations
- The core backend functionality is now solid with full CRUD operations
- Authentication and role-based permissions are working as expected
- The test suite confirms functionality of critical paths

## Hours Worked
- Backend development: 6 hours
- Testing and debugging: 2 hours
- Documentation and planning: 1 hour
